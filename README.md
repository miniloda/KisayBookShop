# KisayBookShop
Hello!
This project is about handling purchase transactions for a database workshop and adding Book Data.
This project is meant for my Math154 project, if you stumble upon this project and want it to fork, you can; 
However, you should be warned that:

-I used a localhost and a local database for this project using mysql, so you should read that part and configure yours.
I wanted to use the google cloud platforms but it was very hard to implement.
-The CSV i used for the book data is there
