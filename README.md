# KisayBookShop
Hello!
This project is about handling purchase transactions for a bookshop and adding Book Data and transaction data to a database. I
used java swing to make the UI and mySQL for the syntax.
This project is meant for my Math154 project, if you stumble upon this project and want it to fork, you can; 
However, you should be warned that:

-I used a localhost and a local database for this project using mysql, so you should read that part and configure yours.
I wanted to use the google cloud platforms but it was very hard to implement.
-The CSV i used for the book data is there
